Jamie Duncan is a PhD student at the University of Toronto's Centre for Criminology and Sociolegal Studies. His work engages with the impacts of data-driven technology on interactions between governments, citizens, and markets. His doctoral research will focus on the impacts of transnational policy collaboration on border policing in Canada, especially as it relates to processes of shared technology adoption. Jamie has also written and spoken on topics like policing and citizenship in 'smart' cities, the role of the mass media in global security governance, and issues of government secrecy and transparency in Canada. He works as a researcher for the CEntre for Access to INformation and JUstice at the University of Winnipeg. For the 2020-21 academic year, Jamie also holds positions as a Junior Fellow at Massey College and a Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Toronto Ethics of AI Lab.
